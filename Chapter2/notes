Exercise #1
There’s an age old puzzle that goes as follows: You’re at a river with two buckets. One holds exactly 3 liters, and one holds exactly 5 liters. Figure out how to measure out exactly 4 liters using those two buckets.

Develop two different algorithms for measuring out 4 liters.
Which of your algorithms is more efficient? That is, how many steps does each algorithm take? 
re: the most efficient for me is 5 steps

Exercise #2
How many steps would it take to insert the number 7 into the ordered array of 

[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]?
4 + 3 + 1 = 8 steps

Exercise #3
How many steps would it take to search for the number 8 in the ordered array: 

[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]?

re: 4 steps lineal search
3 steps binary search

Exercise #4
How many steps does it take to perform binary search on array of size 200?
re : 8 steps

200/2 = 100/2 = 50 / 2= 25/2= 13 / 2 = 7 / 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2 / 2 =1
re: 8 steps

Exercise #5
How many steps does it take to perform binary search on array of size 400?
re: 9 steps

Exercise #6
Use your favorite object-oriented programming language to create a class that represents an ordered array. It should include functions/methods that serve as the key operations: Read, search, insert, and delete. Ensure that the insert operation inserts the value in the correct place within the ordered array.
